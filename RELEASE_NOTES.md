### Core

- Invoice CRUD with multi-line items, PDF generation, and hash integrity tracking

- Configurable invoice PDF templates (Default Classic, Modern Blue) — dynamically discovered
- Customer management with tax types (non-EU, EU B2B, standard IVA)
- Contractor and bank account management
- Dashboard: quarterly income tables, tax brackets, exchange rates, upcoming holidays and tax deadlines
- Configurable tax rates: VAT and quarterly tax advance rates editable in Settings → General → Tax Rates
- Dynamic Base Currency dropdown built from Tracked Currencies (50+ currency symbols supported)
- Authentication with setup wizard, password change, encrypted config
- Activity logging — file-based (JSON-lines) or database-backed, configurable retention
- Task scheduler — lightweight daemon for periodic jobs (daily backups, cleanup)
- Settings: independent tab-based architecture — each tab saves without affecting others

### Module System

- Tax hooks: `calculate_income_tax(context)`, `calculate_vat(context)`, `get_tax_obligations(context)` — enables country-specific tax modules
